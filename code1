# Explanation:
# Initial Checks:
# Directly return values for k = 0 and k = 1 as they are constant.

# Main Calculation Loop:
# Start with initial values of c, x, and a.
# Use a dictionary ct to store the number of ways to reach each stair k.
# Iteratively update ct with values calculated from array a.
# Compute the next row of Pascal's triangle-like coefficients using aa.
# Update c and x for the next iteration.

# Return Result:
# After the loop completes, return the number of ways to reach stair k from dictionary ct,
# or 0 if k is not found.

# Example Usage:
# Demonstrate the usage of the Solution class by printing results for various test cases.
# This consolidated version retains clarity and efficiency while ensuring correctness
# in computing the number of ways Alice can reach any stair up to a very large number (1e9).
# Each step is now explained with comments to clarify its purpose and functionality.
